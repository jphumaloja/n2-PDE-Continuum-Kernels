# Stabilization of n+m PDEs using continuum kernels

The purpose of these MATLAB codes is to reproduce the simulation results from Section 6 of the paper "Backstepping Control of Continua of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs and Application to Stabilization of Large-Scale n+m Coupled Hyperbolic PDE Systems" by Jukka-Pekka Humaloja and Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis which is accepted for publication in Automatica. The preprint of the paper is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22067).

The mathematical background and the documentation for the codes are briefly desribed in the file "codesdoc.pdf.".

## Requirements

The codes require MATLAB.

## Usage

The simulation results of Section 6 can be reproduced by running the script n2system.m.
